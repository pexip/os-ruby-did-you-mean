Description: smart error messages for Ruby > 2.3
 This package provides the infrastructure to produce smart error messages on
 Ruby > 2.3.  When an undefined method is called, it will suggest similar
 method names. It will also catch mispellings on known method names, such as
 "initialize", and warn developers about them.
 .
 Starting with version 2.3, the Ruby interpreter will automatically load this
 library on startup.
